            <p class="menu-item-details">Loosely translated as leaf dumpling, patrode is a savory vegetarian dish from Malvani and Maharashtrian cuisine. Basic ingredients are the same throughout the entire region—colocasia leaves stuffed (or chopped up) with a mixture of gram flour, rice flour, tamarind, jaggery, and various spices, while patrode variations differ only in shape (sliced rolls or dumplings) and the cooking method (steamed or fried).It is very similar to the alu vadi or gujarati patra recipe but made with coconut and rice batter. It is a perfect snack or perhaps a side dish to the regular meal and is served with a generous amount of coconut oil topping.</p>
